    <p>My current gig.  I've had the wonderful opportunity to watch this company
    grow from a mere 5 employees to around 30, across both California and Bangalore.</p>

    <p>As one of the longest tenured engineers, I've worked on pretty much
    every component in our stack, but most of my days are spend on middle-tier
    systems in Java/Groovy on Grails, including billing integrations with
    Braintree, PayPal and Shopify, overlaying our own subscription billing
    handling on top of these services.</p>

    <p>On other days, I hack on our Ruby on Rails frontend, diving into the odd
    bit of CSS/JavaScript (not my forte).</p>

    <p>I write code and design systems, play around with devops and sit in on
    business calls with business and technology partners.  I've done
    quite a bit of everything, and it's been incredibly rewarding.</p>

    <p>We're doing <a href="http://commercecentral.lexity.com">big things</a>, so
    be on the lookout!</p>

    <p>I worked on the Platform team at LogLogic, writing software for their
    log management and compliance network appliances.  These were Linux-based
    systems with a heavily customized OS that was basically LFS with some
    additional tooling (Rock Linux, and its successor, T2).</p>

    <p>The code was mostly C and Python (for the OS management software that
    was custom to the appliance).  I remember a lot of reverse engineering of
    RedHat installer code when we were trying to port the software over to
    CentOS.</p>

    <p>I learned, and have subsequently forgotten, a good amount of software
    RAID management and rescuing Linux installations on the brink of failure.
    I can also do cruel and unusual things with initrds.</p>

    <p>Among other things, I rolled out security patches for SPAWAR, attended
    BlizzCon '09 with half my team and the QA team, and managed to get a patch
    accepted for git-svn, allowing it to work with SVN repositories under
    subdirectories.</p>

    <p>TeleNav was a great place to start my career.  I had the good fortune
    to work with an exception manager, an inspiring mentor, and a great
    team.</p>

    <p>I worked on a lot of fun projects while at TeleNav - I was on the
    original team to get traffic-aware GPS navigation launched, and I was also
    part of a grand rewrite of their map server architecture.  We
    reimplemented, almost from scratch, a server capable of calculating
    least-cost paths from point A to B, as well as serve up map features and
    POIs.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I also ended up running point for all releases,
    coordinating cross-functionally as well as internationally.  I visited the
    office in Shanghai twice, once to work on traffic-aware routing, and again
    to roll out full-Linux development environments (the office there was very
    much a Microsoft shop).  I also ran point for most P0 alerts and worked
    really closely with the Ops team there.</p>
